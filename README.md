# ML-CEP

Project made for Machine Learning course, which compares the performance of different Machine Learning models on performing binary classification.

The dataset used is the CIFAR-10 dataset in which 10 original classes were binarized into Animal and Vehicle classes.

The Machine Learning models used are:
1. Logistics Regression (parametric algorithm): used from sklearn library
2. XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) (non-parametric algorithm): uses ensemble learning techniques to improve gradient in quick succession
3. CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)

Libraries used are Pandas, Numpy, PIL (Pillow Imaging Library) and OpenCV which are used for preprocessing and data handling.
